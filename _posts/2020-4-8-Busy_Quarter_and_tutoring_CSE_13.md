title: Busy Quarter and Tutoring CSE13 -- Intro to Embedded C programming
---

What a crazy quarter this is turning out to be, four classes, tutoring, and it's all online. Ended up getting a message from professor Dunne to tutor the Embedded C programming class, and I couldn't say no, it get another TA title under my belt and some extra funds is too good. This will also include grading too, so I'm going to have to balance my time wisely. Which at this time is easier said than done, my productivity has been taking a hit due to the quarantine, I really need to hit my stride to maintain my momentum.

I'll also have to be stricter with my time in capstone and balance work between myself and my teammate Lisa more. Last quarter I roughly had more time. So when she got pre-occupied with the UCSC sensors technology class, I was able take on the most of the PC-MCU interface and documentation. This quarter, I don't think I'll be able to haul myself to refactoring the GUI module entirely by myself. So, I'm going to have to hold her up to what she needs to do, hopefully, the restructure of the Trello board that me and my team did will help with that. The 'check-off' by another member should be useful and kick some people into gear.

Wrote while listening to Ma Rainey. My US popular music class I'm taking as general education class is introducing me to a lot of cool artists. Haven't really listened to blues music, so I've been digging into some of those artists today. I've also been listening to Yaeji's new album, What We Drew 우리가 그려왔, that came out earlier this week. It's fantastic, has a ambient house feel to it like Aphex Twin's SAW 85-92.

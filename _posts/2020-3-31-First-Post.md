I figured a blog would be a good place to work on my writting skills and help improve communication over what I'm researching/working on. While school has pushed me to write reports on all the technical work I've done through classes, however, classes won't last forever. After school I most definitly push myself to improve my technical skills. So, when researching and self-studying computer science, working on projects and whatever else, I plan on discussing it here. One of the professors I had, Kevin Karplus, is a compulsive blogger on the statistics of his life and the class he teaches, I think that's admirable and a fun way to communicate life and work. Even if it may be talking into a void, it'll be good to get everything off my chest.

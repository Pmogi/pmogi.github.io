Patrick Mogianesi, a graduating Bioengineering student from University of California, Santa Cruz with an interest in technical problem solving, coding and embedded systems.

### More Information
I have a Bachelors of Science in Bioengineering where I opted for the bioelectronics concentration, while there I learned the essentials of circuit analysis of RLC and transistor circuits and a heap of classes on embedded systems. I have experience with the PIC32 architecture, Verilog and Arduino. During my senior capstone I wrote the driving code for packet communication between a PC and MCU that used CRC-8 data integrity checks. On the PC and MCU I wrote the packet protocol system. I worked with two other teammates on establishing a GUI interface using the Python Tkinter library, where I directed the technical implementation of the widgets. The repository for this work can be seen [here](https://github.com/quail-mail/googun). This work also also led me to REALLY learn how to use Git when working on the GUI with others, short SCRUM meetings were implemented for updates on progress and merging feature branches that allowed for accelerated progress towards the end of the project.

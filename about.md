Patrick Mogianesi, Queer nerd that is interested in embedded systems and engineering.

### More Information

Hello, thanks for coming to my small space on the internet!

Let's break this down in steps:

1. Queer -- as is in non-binary / bisexual.

2. Nerd, as in I'm interested in a lot of technical things. However, I tend to grab a lot of hobbies and not delve to deep into them. My current creative and active interests as of now are:
  1. Music -- I'm a beginer guitar and piano player, and I listen to lot of music, some of my favorites being Aphex Twin, Vampire Weekend and Talking Heads. (and Yung Lean...)
  2. 3D-CGI -- I've been following tutorial on using Blender and having a blast doing so. I highly recommend it as a creative hobby.
  3. Cycling -- Somewhat of a novice cycler, I love riding around and exploring on bike. Great cardio too.
  4. Gardening -- Hold me to this blog, I'm interested in getting more into gardening. Having a fresh herb garden is a goal.
3. Embedded systems -- Arduino is good fun, interested in getting hands-on with bare ARM processor programming. During university, I got all too familiar with the PIC32 architecture.
4. Engineering -- Along with software, I think electronics are exciting. I never had the time in university to get too hands on with electronics, but I'm familiar with transistor micro-electronics and basic circuit analysis/filters. Thevenin was a pretty cool guy.

Patrick Mogianesi, Queer nerd that is interested in embedded systems and engineering.

### More Information

Hello, thanks for coming to my small space on the internet!

Let's break this down in steps:

1. Queer is an non-binary.

2. Nerd, as in I'm interested in a lot of technical things. However, I tend to grab a lot of hobbies and not delve to deep into them. My current creative and active interests as of now are:
  1. Music! I'm a beginer guitar and piano player, and I listen to lot of music, some of my favorites being Aphex Twin, Vampire Weekend and Talking Heads.




I'm a graduating student from University of California, Santa Cruz that studies bio-electronics. Most of the experience I got in my education was in electrical and computer engineering, particularly embedded systems.

Patrick Mogianesi, queer nerd that is interested in embedded systems, and coding.

### More Information

Hello, thanks for coming to my small space on the internet!

Let's break this down in steps:

1. Queer -- as is in non-binary, (they/them).

2. Nerd, as in I'm interested in a lot of technical things. However, I tend to grab a lot of hobbies and not delve to deep into them. My current creative and active interests as of now are:

    1. Music -- I'm a beginner piano player, and I listen to lot of music. I enjoy music of all varieties but some of my favorite bands/artists are Aphex Twin, Vampire Weekend, High on Fire, Eno, and My Bloody Valentine.

    2. 3D-CGI -- I've been following tutorial on using Blender and having a blast doing so. I highly recommend it as a creative hobby.

    3. Cycling -- Somewhat of a novice cycler, I love riding around and exploring on bike.

    4. Gardening -- Hold me to this blog, I'm interested in getting more into gardening. Having a fresh herb garden is a goal.

3. Embedded systems -- I ended up taking a lot of embedded programming classes during university, which was partially unintended. But in the process I got interested in microcontroller architecture and driving circuits for sensors.

4. Coding -- I've got plenty of experience in C due to my PIC architecture orientated embedded classes, and due to my senior project, where I wrote serial communication driving code between a Teensy MCU using C/C++ and a Python PC application.
